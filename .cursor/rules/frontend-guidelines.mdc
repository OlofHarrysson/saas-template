## Frontend (Website)

The frontend code is located under `/website`.

Here are some config values that could be important [site-config.ts](mdc:website/src/app/site-config.ts)

### Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15.3.5 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom theme
- **UI Components**: DaisyUI (preferred), otherwise Tailwind CSS
- **Authentication**: Auth.js (NextAuth v5) with Google OAuth and Resend magic links
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL with Auth.js adapter
- **Email Provider**: Resend for magic link authentication
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **State Management**: Zustand for global state management
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first with desktop support. This includes smaller padding and font sizes for mobile since the screen is smaller, and sometimes requires a different design for mobile and desktop.
- **Icons**: Lucide icons instead of inline SVGs.

### File Organization

Group related files into one subdirectory to avoid clutter (but don't over-nest):

```
components/auth/LoginForm.tsx
hooks/payments/useCheckout.ts
actions/users/createUser.ts
types/api/responses.ts
lib/posthog/client.ts
stores/cart/useCartStore.ts
```

One level of grouping is enough — avoid deeper nesting.

### Theme Requirements

The application should implement a consistent theme using:

1.  **Color System**:

    - Use semantic color pairs with DEFAULT/foreground pattern:
      ```typescript
      primary: {
        DEFAULT: "var(--primary)",
        foreground: "var(--primary-foreground)",
      }
      ```

2.  **Design Philosophy**:
    - Minimalist, clean interfaces with ample white space.
    - Typography: Clear hierarchy using size and weight, not color.
