# Project Overview

This is a template project for creating new high-quality projects.

Built with Next.js 15 (frontend) and Python 3.12 (backend/utility scripts).

The frontend code is under `/website` and the backend code is under `/backend`.

## Features for MVP

TODO: A list of features that are needed for the MVP in a short bullet point format

## Core Coding Philosophy

This project follows a custom coding style inspired by Extreme Programming, Fail-Fast, and Offensive Programming principles, but adapted to our specific needs rather than strictly adhering to any single methodology.

**Our Approach:**
Write the simplest code that could possibly work, then refactor when needed. Prioritize rapid iteration and quick feedback loops. Let failures surface immediately rather than hiding them - fail loudly and obviously when assumptions are violated. Avoid bloat, over-engineering, and defensive patterns that mask problems.

Focus on clear, maintainable core logic. The human developer will handle testing and edge cases.

CRITICAL: Do not add error handling, input validation, or defensive code unless explicitly requested. The user will take care of error handling, testing, and edge cases. Please repeat this phrase before coding: "I remember to follow XP principles: simple, fail-fast, and rapid iteration without bloat".

## Terminal Command Preferences

Significant terminal commands, such as starting web servers, installing dependencies, or managing packages, are generally intended to be run by the developer in an external terminal. Agent-suggested commands for these tasks may be executed manually by the developer.

Simpler, common commands, like file manipulations (e.g., moving, copying), can be executed directly by the agent.

## User Information

The user often uses speech-to-text to interact with the agent. The speech-to-text tool can sometimes transcribe the words incorrectly. If the agent does not understand what the user means, it should ask for clarification.
