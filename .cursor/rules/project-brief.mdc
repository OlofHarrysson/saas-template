# Project Overview

This is a template project for creating new high-quality projects.

Built with Next.js 15 (frontend) and Python 3.12 (backend/utility scripts).

The frontend code is under `/website` and the backend code is under `/backend`.

## Features for MVP

TODO: A list of features that are needed for the MVP in a short bullet point format

## Core Coding Philosophy

This project follows a custom coding style inspired by Extreme Programming, Fail-Fast, and Offensive Programming principles, but adapted to our specific needs rather than strictly adhering to any single methodology.

**Our Approach:**
Write the simplest code that could possibly work, then refactor when needed. Prioritize rapid iteration and quick feedback loops. Let failures surface immediately rather than hiding them - fail loudly and obviously when assumptions are violated. Avoid bloat, over-engineering, and defensive patterns that mask problems.

Focus on clear, maintainable core logic. The human developer will handle testing and edge cases.

CRITICAL: Do not add error handling, input validation, or defensive code unless explicitly requested. The user will take care of error handling, testing, and edge cases. Please repeat this phrase before coding: "I remember to follow XP principles: simple, fail-fast, and rapid iteration without bloat".

## Terminal Commands

- Long-running commands (e.g., starting servers): do NOT run
- Short commands (filesystem ops, package installs): run directly
- To add packages: run install commands, don't edit requirements files

## User Information

User uses speech-to-text. Words may be cut off at start/end, or transcribed incorrectly. Ask if unclear.
